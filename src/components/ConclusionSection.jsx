              My internship at{" "}
              <strong>UN Global Compact Network Singapore (UNGCNS) </strong>
              was a transformative journey at the intersection of
              <strong> sustainability</strong>, <strong>digitalisation</strong>,
              and
              <strong> global stakeholder engagement</strong>. Over three
              months, I moved beyond executing marketing tasks to thinking
              strategically about how communication can drive
              <strong> measurable engagement</strong> and
              <strong> organisational growth</strong>. <br></br>From managing
              LinkedIn and Mailchimp campaigns to expanding international
              outreach for the <strong>Apex Awards</strong>, I experienced
              firsthand how digital platforms can amplify sustainability
              advocacy on a regional and global scale.

              A defining difference in this internship was the
              <strong>
                {" "}
                level of global exposure and cross‑cultural collaboration
              </strong>{" "}
              I experienced. At UNGCNS, I worked closely with colleagues and
              stakeholders from <strong>highly diverse backgrounds</strong>
              —including team members and partners from Myanmar, India,
              Australia, the UK, Indonesia, and more. <br></br>I also had the
              opportunity to communicate with{" "}
              <strong>international stakeholders</strong> such as
              <strong> UNDP</strong>, strengthening my ability to adapt to
              diverse communication styles and expectations. I learnt to be more
              structured, concise and proactive in managing cross-cultural
              collaborations. This experience expanded my perspective from a
              local operational mindset to one grounded in
              <strong> international accountability</strong> and
              <strong> cross-border professionalism</strong>.

              Through managing LinkedIn (11,000+ followers), Mailchimp (8,000+
              subscribers), Canva campaigns, lead-generation pipelines and
              website systems, I developed strong capabilities in
              <strong> integrated digital marketing</strong>,
              <strong> stakeholder coordination</strong>,
              <strong> data tracking</strong> and
              <strong> self-directed learning</strong>. Implementing process
              improvements such as
              <strong> WP Mail SMTP automation</strong> enhanced internal
              coordination and reduced manual inefficiencies across departments.
              More importantly, I shifted from simply completing tasks to asking
              strategic questions: How can engagement be optimised? How can
              systems be made more efficient? That mindset shift marked my
              biggest professional growth.

              <strong> emotional resilience</strong> and
              <strong> people-management maturity</strong>. Working under high
              expectations and tight timelines taught me how to prioritise
              effectively, manage upwards, and communicate progress proactively.
              I learnt that professional growth is not just about capability, it
              is about <strong> composure under pressure</strong>,

              </strong>
              . It bridged classroom concepts such as integrated marketing and
              stakeholder communication with real-world global execution. More
              importantly, it <strong>reshaped my mindset</strong>, from
              completing tasks to building systems, from supporting campaigns to
              strengthening ecosystems. I leave this internship more confident,
              globally aware, and equipped to contribute meaningfully in future
              roles.
